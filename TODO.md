  - Need to properly log DID transactions to audit journal
  - Implement real audit trail with Transaction objects

### 🎯 **Medium Priority: Enhance v0.2.2**
- [ ] **Improve error handling**
  - Add better error messages for CLI commands
  - Handle edge cases in identity resolution
  - Validate DID formats properly

- [ ] **Add persistence**
  - Save DID registry to file
  - Persist account balances
  - Store audit journal to disk

- [ ] **Real cryptographic signing**
  - Currently using mock signatures
  - Integrate zSig for actual Ed25519 signing
  - Verify transaction signatures properly

## 🎯 **TODAY'S SPECIFIC TASKS** (July 17)

### **Morning (9-12):**
1. [ ] Fix memory leaks in `src/cli.zig`
   - Add proper `defer` cleanup for allocations
   - Fix Shroud identity generation leaks
   - Test with `zig build test`

2. [ ] Fix journal logging system
   - Either simplify Transaction struct usage
   - Or create proper Transaction objects for logging
   - Test audit commands work properly

### **Afternoon (1-5):**
3. [ ] Implement real transaction processing
   - Connect to zWallet for UTXO handling
   - Use zSig for actual signature creation
   - Remove mock signature generation

4. [ ] Add file persistence
   - Save DID registry to `did_registry.json`
   - Persist ledger state to `ledger_state.json`
   - Load state on CLI startup

### **Evening (6-8):**
5. [ ] Create unit tests
   - Test DID creation and resolution
   - Test permission granting/checking
   - Test transaction creation and verification

6. [ ] Update documentation
