  Beyond Identity & Audit:

  - ✅ Execution Layer - Actually runs/executes operations (not just logs them)
  - ✅ Distributed Systems Hub - Coordinates across multiple nodes/systems
  - ✅ Web3 Runtime - Provides execution environment for smart contracts/dApps
  - ✅ Transactional Infrastructure - Handles secure transaction processing

  Integration Architecture:

  - 🔗 Tight integration with zledger - Core financial operations
  - 🔗 Optional shroud support - Privacy layer when needed
  - 🔗 Optional zsig support - Cryptographic operations
  - 🔗 Optional zwallet support - Wallet functionality

  So Keystone is basically the "operating system" of your crypto/Web3 stack - it's the
  execution environment that everything else plugs into, not just an identity manager.

  That makes it way more significant than I initially described - it's the core platform that
  runs your entire distributed application ecosystem!

  Makes sense why it's named "Keystone" - it's the central architectural piece that holds
  everything together. 🏗️
